<h3>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h3>
<p>The first edition of <i>Forest Trees of Texas&mdash;How to Know
Them</i> was assembled by W. R. Matoon and C. B. Webster in
1928. The sections, &ldquo;Trees as Mankind&rsquo;s Friends&rdquo;, &ldquo;Studying
a Tree&rdquo;, &ldquo;Other Texas Trees&rdquo;, drawings of twigs, leaves and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fruit">fruits</a>, and the glossary were incorporated into the fourth and
fifth editions by S. L. Frost and D. A. Anderson. The sixth
and seventh editions were edited by H. E. Weaver and W. A.
Smith, respectively. Some of the drawings used in this publication
were made available by the United States Forest Service.</p>
<p>The eighth edition was revised and edited by John A.
Haislet to conform with the nomenclature in <i>Check List of
Native and Naturalized Trees of the United States (Including
Alaska)</i>, Agriculture Handbook No. 41, prepared under the
direction of the United States Forest Service Tree and Range
Plant Committee. D. A. Anderson&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Guide to the Identification
of the Principal Trees and Shrubs of Texas&rdquo; was revised
and incorporated in the eighth edition to give it greater utility
to the non-technical student of trees.</p>

<p>Trees have held an important place in man&rsquo;s way of life
since he has been on the earth. Trees provided early
man with weapons to defend himself and helped provide him
with food, shelter and fuel.</p>
<p>Trees have played an important role in the history of the
United States. Timber was our nation&rsquo;s first export. The
forest also provided our forefathers with their homes, farm
implements, rifle stocks and wagons. The forest, by furnishing
ties and utility poles, made possible the expansion of railroad
systems, electric power and telephone networks. Every
industry depends upon forest products in one way or another.</p>
<p>Trees are more important today than ever before. More
than 10,000 products are reportedly made from trees. Through
chemistry, the humble woodpile is yielding chemicals, plastics
and fabrics that were beyond comprehension when an axe first
felled a Texas tree.</p>
<p>The American standard of living depends to no small
extent on the care with which we use our forest resource.
Fortunately, trees are a renewable resource. They can be
grown as a crop and harvested in such a way that the stand
is kept productive, and a steady supply of forest products is
assured.</p>
<h3>TEXAS TREES</h3>
<p>A tree is generally defined as a woody plant having one
well-defined stem and a more or less definitely formed <a class="gloss" href="#g_Crown">crown</a>,
usually attaining a height of at least eight feet. Using water
and minerals from the soil, gases from the air and energy
from the sun, a tree manufactures the food it needs for growth
and reproduction. Trees, like man, grow rapidly when they
are young but gradually their growth decreases; they begin
to deteriorate and eventually die. Nature then reduces them
to the elements from which they were derived.</p>
<p>The terms &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Hardwood">hardwood</a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Softwood">softwood</a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Deciduous">deciduous</a>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;non-deciduous&rdquo; are often encountered in tree literature. These
terms are confusing and often misleading. Needle-bearing or
cone-bearing trees are designated as softwoods even though
the wood may be dense. Hardwoods are the broad-leaved
(unlike needles or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Scales">scales</a>) trees, the wood of which may be
dense or soft.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Conifers">conifers</a>, or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Softwood">softwoods</a>, generally retain their leaves
more than one growing season and produce seed in cones;
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
however, there are exceptions. Baldcypress, a conifer, is
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Deciduous">deciduous</a> since it sheds its leaves in autumn. Cedar and juniper
produce berry-like cones that scarcely resemble cones.</p>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hardwood">hardwoods</a>, or broad-leaved trees, are generally <a class="gloss" href="#g_Deciduous">deciduous</a>;
i.e., they shed their leaves in autumn. Texas has
many exceptions, for example: southern magnolia, live oak
and American holly which retain green leaves through the
winter.</p>
<p>More than half of the 1,100 species of native trees in the
United States are found in the South. Of these, more than
200 species and varieties are native to Texas. In addition,
many <a class="gloss" href="#g_Exotic">exotic</a> species have been introduced and now grow in
many parts of the state.</p>
<p>The four main forest regions of Texas include: the
Southern pine forest in East Texas; the central <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hardwood">hardwoods</a>, the
post oak and cross timbers of North-central Texas; the semi-tropical
forest in the Rio Grande Valley region of Texas; and
the mountain forest, the timbered areas of West Texas which
are a continuation of the timber types of the Southern Rocky
Mountains. In Texas, trees are the principal vegetative cover
on an estimated area of 28,805,617 acres.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Texas also has minor tree areas which are almost restricted
to Texas; the cedar breaks and the oak shinneries. Some of
the shinnery trees are among the smallest in America. In
places, fully matured trees are not over knee-high and resemble
pigmy forests. In other areas, the same species grows 20 to 30
feet tall to form almost impenetrable thickets.</p>
<p>The pine-hardwood forests of East Texas, comprise 12,525,417
acres in all or part of 42 counties. Lumber, paper,
baskets, boxes, ties, poles, piling, posts, handles and shingles
constitute the main forest products manufactured in the Piney
Woods of East Texas.</p>
<p>Farther west, in East Central Texas, the post oak forests
cover approximately 5,030,200 acres in all or part of 39 counties.</p>
<p>The east and west &ldquo;cross timbers&rdquo;, occur on an area of
approximately 3 million acres. The term &ldquo;cross timbers&rdquo; originated
with the early settlers who, in their travels from east to
west, crossed alternating patches of forests and prairies and
so affixed the name &ldquo;cross timbers&rdquo; to these forests.</p>
<p>Farther south in the Edwards Plateau region, are the cedar
breaks which extend over 3&frac34; million acres. Cedar grows on
the steep slopes and rolling hills common to this region, in
association with live oak and mesquite.</p>
<p>Other tree areas of the state include an estimated 500,000
acres of mountain forests in the Trans-Pecos Region and the
live oak area along the Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>Two of Texas&rsquo; trees, guaiacum and ebony, produce the
hardest woods in the United States. Both species are found in
the Rio Grande Valley. The tree with the lightest wood in the
United States, corkwood, grows near the mouth of the Brazos
River. Drooping or weeping juniper, so named for the drooping
characteristic of its branches, grows in the Big Bend area
but has not been reported to be native elsewhere in this country.</p>
<p>Catclaw, huisache, mimosa, baretta, pistache, black persimmon,
Mexican ash, anaqua, flatwoods plum (sloe) and
guajillo are other trees common only in Texas.</p>
<h3>TEXAS FOREST SERVICE</h3>
<p>In 1915, the 34th Texas Legislature created by law the
State Department of Forestry and made it a part of the Agricultural
and Mechanical College of Texas. In 1925, the department
became the Texas Forest Service. As it grew, its service
to Texas increased. It now helps protect Texas&rsquo; forest resources
against fire, insects and disease; assists woodland
owners in the proper management of their lands; makes available
seedlings for reforestation and windbreak purposes; conducts
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
research in forest tree improvement, management and
utilization; and conducts an educational program to acquaint
Texans as to the desirability of practicing forestry.</p>
<p>The Texas Forest Service, with more than 300 employees,
has four departments: Forest Fire Control, Forest Management,
Forest Products, and Information and Education. The
offices of the Director, and of the Forest Management and the
Information and Education Departments are in College Station.
Forest Fire Control and Forest Products Department
headquarters are in Lufkin.</p>
<p>Seven administrative districts, each headed by a district
forester, are responsible for the activities of the Texas Forest
Service in the areas of intensive and extensive forest fire protection.
District headquarters are located at Linden, Henderson,
Lufkin, Woodville, Kirbyville, Conroe and College Station.</p>
<p>More than 10 million acres of state and privately owned
timberland in the Piney Woods are now under intensive protection
against fire, insects and diseases. An additional area
of 5 million acres, commonly referred to as the post oak region,
west of and adjacent to the pine-hardwood area, has been
under extensive protection beginning with 1962.</p>
<h3>TEXAS FORESTRY ASSOCIATION</h3>
<p>The Texas Forestry Association is a statewide, nonprofit
agency concerned primarily with the educational phase of
forest conservation. Organized in 1914, the Association was
largely responsible for the passage of the law which created
the Department of Forestry at the Agricultural and Mechanical
College of Texas, and from which the Texas Forest Service
emerged.</p>
<p>For more than 48 years, this organization has cooperated
with the Texas Forest Service and other interested agencies in
promoting the forest economy of Texas. Membership in the
Texas Forestry Association is open to all conservation-minded
citizens.</p>
<h3>ARBOR DAY</h3>
<p>The growing dependency of man upon forest resources
for raw materials, products, watershed protection, conservation
of certain wildlife and recreation gives added significance to
Arbor Day which is set aside annually to pay tribute to trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Arbor Day originated in Nebraska in 1872. It was first
celebrated in Texas in 1889 on George Washington&rsquo;s birthday,
February 22. In 1949, the Texas State Legislature adopted
the following resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the
State of Texas, the Senate concurring, That the third
Friday in January of each year be designated as &ldquo;Arbor
Day&rdquo;, to be devoted to the planting and cultivation of
forest, shade and ornamental trees throughout the State
and to be observed for that purpose in such manner as
may seem best to the people of each community; and be
it further</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved, That the Governor of Texas be requested
to issue an appropriate proclamation annually to encourage
the proper observance of such &ldquo;Arbor Day&rdquo;.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arbor Day can best be celebrated by planting one or
more suitable trees around a school or club area or by establishing
a school plantation. In addition to paying tribute to
the beauty of trees, one can call attention to the importance
of trees to man&rsquo;s welfare. The Texas Forest Service continues
to assist clubs and schools in organizing Arbor Day programs.</p>
<h3>STATE TREE</h3>
<p>The pecan, <i>Carya illinoensis</i>, (Wangenh.) K. Koch, was
officially designated as the state tree of Texas by an act of the
legislature in June 1919.</p>
<p>By an amendment in 1927, certain state agencies were
requested to give due consideration to the pecan tree when
beautifying state parks and other public property belonging
to the state.</p>

<h2 id="c3">STUDYING TREES</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/img002.jpg" alt="Teacher" width="500" height="490" />
</div>
<p class="tree">Trees, like people, become friends only when we have
become well acquainted with them and have a knowledge of
the characteristics that make them something special to us.
This bulletin about the trees of Texas may be used as a handy
reference for identifying trees you do not know, or it may be
used as the basis for developing tree friends. The following
is a guide or lesson plan that will help make a friend of each
tree studied.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/img002a.jpg" alt="Students" width="500" height="269" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<dl class="undent"><dt><b>I. Object of Study</b></dt>
<dt class="tu">Each kind of tree has certain identifying characteristics which mark it as being different from other kinds of species of trees. By careful observation and examination these identifying points may be learned and you can feel that you know the tree.</dt>
<dt><b>II. Source of Study Material</b></dt>
<dd>1. The locality in which you live probably has some trees you know. Why do you know them? Start by studying these trees and make them fast friends.</dd>
<dd>2. You also will find some trees you are not sure about or do not know; next, study these one by one until you are sure you will always know them.</dd>
<dd>3. Wherever you may be or whenever you see a tree you do not know, observe it carefully, collect enough facts and sample material to study until you learn to know it.</dd>
<dd>4. Books, articles, pictures and references will help to learn some trees you cannot actually see but which are of interest to you.</dd>
<dt><b>III. Approach to Tree Study</b></dt>
<dd>1. One tree should be studied at a time as a general rule although it may be an advantage to select somewhat similar trees and study them by comparisons.</dd>
<dd>2. Field study of the growing tree is the most satisfactory. Observe a number of the same kind of trees as there are individual variations in some characteristics.</dd>
<dd>3. If possible collect for reference and further study samples of leaves, twigs, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bark">bark</a>, wood, flowers and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fruit">fruit</a>. BE CAREFUL in collecting samples. It is better not to have samples than to deface or injure the tree. No one will object to your studying their trees if you do no damage.</dd>
<dt><b>IV. Procedure</b></dt>
<dd>1. General</dd>
<dd class="t">(a) First observe the tree as a whole taking into consideration all the points that attract your attention. Very often there will be some one thing that either alone or in relation to other points attracts your attention. That feature when studied may be the key to your really learning to know the tree.</dd>
<dd class="t">(b) The suggestions that follow as to observations of various parts of the tree do not limit the study of those points for perhaps you will learn to know the tree from some feature not listed.</dd>
<dd>2. Form of tree</dd>
<dd class="tu">Note the size, shape and branching habit; observe its location in relation to other trees that might affect its form.</dd>
<dt class="pb" id="Page_10">10</dt>
<dd>3. Bark</dd>
<dd class="tu">Observe thickness, roughness, type of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fissures">fissures</a> and color of bark. Studying the bark as a means of winter identification is particularly worthwhile.</dd>
<dd>4. Leaves</dd>
<dd class="tu">Study type, size, shape and variations on the same tree; note arrangement on twigs; describe by the blade, stalk, margin, venation, base and tip; know their texture and color.</dd>
<dd>5. Twigs</dd>
<dd class="tu">Note <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lateral">lateral</a> arrangement on branches; observe whether flexible or stocky and whether rough or smooth; study differences between new growth and old; learn any distinctive color, smell, or taste; cut a cross-section and note size, shape, color and size of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pith">pith</a>; note presence or absence of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Lenticel">lenticels</a>.</dd>
<dd>6. Buds</dd>
<dd class="tu">Like bark, the buds are helpful in winter identification. Note size, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Scales">scale</a> coverings, and shape. Observe arrangement and position on twigs; compare <a class="gloss" href="#g_Terminal">terminal</a> and lateral buds.</dd>
<dd>7. <a class="gloss" href="#g_LeafScar">Leaf-scars</a></dd>
<dd class="tu">Study scars left by falling leaves as to size, form, position and occurrence; note bundle-scars (appear as marks in scar) as to number, shape, size, and arrangement.</dd>
<dd>8. Flowers</dd>
<dd class="tu">Study promptly at proper season; trees vary widely in flowering habits; observe as to size, form, shape of parts, color and arrangement; and learn whether the tree has one or two kinds of flowers&mdash;if two, whether male and female flowers are on same tree.</dd>
<dd>9. Fruit</dd>
<dd class="tu">Study of fruit also is seasonal. When it is available, observe type, form, structure and method of distribution.</dd>
<dd>10. Wood</dd>
<dd class="tu">Identification of trees by wood forms a separate study but often field identification of trees can be aided by observation of distinctive points about the wood such as color, taste and general structure.</dd>
<dd>11. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">Habitat</a></dd>
<dd class="tu">An interesting and often useful help in tree identification is to note the growing habits of trees, whether in dry or moist places, what other species same type sites, whether it grows better in open places or in more sheltered locations and the like.</dd>
<dt class="pb" id="Page_11">11</dt>
<dt><b>V. Summary</b></dt>
<dt class="tu">If you have followed through on your study of a tree, covering the eleven points listed, you will really know the tree for all time. However, even if you cannot or do not make your study as thoroughly as is suggested, you should at least select enough distinctive characteristics about the tree to study that you will be able to identify it both in the summer and the winter seasons.</dt>
<dt><b>VI. References</b></dt>
<dt class="tu">Your school and public library should have one or more books on trees. You will find books on southern trees most helpful. While it is impractical to provide a complete list of books on trees, the partial list below is furnished for your information, with the understanding that no discrimination is intended:</dt>

<h3 class="tree"><b>LIMBER PINE</b> (Rocky Mountain White Pine)
<br /><span class="small"><b>Pinus flexilis</b> var. <b>flexilis</b> James</span></h3>
<p>Limber pine is abundant in the Rocky Mountains
and in scattered areas over much of the West. In
Texas, limber pine may be found in the Guadalupe and
Davis Mountains of West Texas.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, the branches and twigs are
especially flexible and tough, often light purple in color.
The branches form a rounded tree top or head.
The trunk is stout and noticeably tapered.</p>
<p>The needle-like LEAVES are in clusters of five.
They are stiff and stout, about 2 to 3 inches long, and
arranged in clusters or tufts near the ends of the
branches. They stay on the twig for five or six years.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fruit">FRUIT</a>&rdquo;, a cone, is relatively short or stocky,
mostly from 3 to 6 inches long, made up of rounded
rather thick <a class="gloss" href="#g_Scales">scales</a>, some turned forward and some
backward. The cone is short-stalked. As with all the
pines, the seeds mature at the end of the second season

<p>The WOOD is relatively soft, close-grained, slightly
yellowish or reddish. It is not cut in quantity and
the trees are usually rather limby and short-bodied,
which largely accounts for the small commercial use.</p>

<h3 class="tree"><b>PINYON</b> (<a class="gloss" href="#g_Nut">Nut</a> Pine)
<br /><span class="small"><b>Pinus edulis</b> Engelm.</span></h3>
<p>Pinyon is found as scattered trees or in small

western part of the state to elevations of 8,000 feet.
It is a small tree, grows on warm slopes or in sheltered
locations, and forms a bushy top with orange-colored
branchlets.</p>
<p>The needle-like LEAVES grow in bundles of two
(rarely 3); whereas in <b>Pinus cembroides</b> Zucc., the
Mexican Pinyon, there are usually three needles per

<p>Like all the pines, it has male and female &ldquo;FLOWERS&rdquo;
separate on the same tree. The &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fruit">FRUIT</a>&rdquo;, a
cone, is rounded, about 1 to 2 inches across, and produces
large seeds or &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Nut">nuts</a>&rdquo;, from &frac12; to &frac34; inch long.
The seeds are rich in food value and form an important
article of diet for the Indians. The seeds are gathered
and sold widely as fancy &ldquo;nuts&rdquo; in many larger towns

<br /><span class="small"><b>Pinus ponderosa</b> Laws.</span></h3>
<p>Ponderosa pine is the most important commercial
pine of the Southwest and many parts of the

<p>The &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fruit">FRUIT</a>&rdquo;, a short-stalked cone, is oval-shaped,
reddish-brown, and armed with stout recurved
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Prickle">prickles</a>.</p>
<p>The WOOD of this species, from trees in the commercial
part of its range, is of excellent quality for
lumber. The wood is hard, strong, and rather fine
grained. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Heartwood">heartwood</a> is light reddish-white and the

<h3 class="tree"><b>LOBLOLLY PINE</b>
<br /><span class="small"><b>Pinus taeda</b> L.</span></h3>
<p>This fast-growing yellow pine is the most abundant
and valuable species in Southeast Texas from
Orange County west to Walker and Waller Counties.
The species is also abundant northward to the Oklahoma
line. Loblolly pine also constitutes the pine of
the &ldquo;Lost Pine Region&rdquo; in the vicinity of Bastrop.</p>

<p class="caption">LOBLOLLY PINE (<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fruit">Fruit</a> and leaves, one-half natural size)</p>
</div>
<p>Loblolly invades abandoned fields rapidly. For this
reason it is often called old field pine. In the virgin
forest of Texas, loblolly pine was most common along
banks of streams. It is still the dominant pine on moist
sites, but may also be found in relatively dry sites.</p>
<p>The dark-colored <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bark">BARK</a> is deeply furrowed and often
attains a thickness of as much as 2 inches on large-sized
trees. The needle-like LEAVES, 6 to 9 inches
long, are borne three (occasionally two) in a cluster.
In the spring bright green clumps of needles grow at
the end of branches and give the tree a luxuriant appearance.
The &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fruit">FRUIT</a>&rdquo;, a cone, ripens in the autumn
of the second year and is 3 to 5 inches long. Many
seeds with wings an inch long are shed during the fall
and early winter.</p>
<p>The resinous WOOD is coarse-grained. There is
marked contrast, as in other yellow pines, between the
bands of springwood and summerwood. The wood of
second-growth trees has a wide range of uses such as
building material, box shooks, barrel staves, basket veneers,
pulpwood, lath, mine props, piling, and fuel.</p>

often hold to the twigs for 3 or 4 years. The small
mottled seeds have a wing which is broadest near the
center.</p>
<p>The WOOD of old trees is rather heavy and hard,
yellow-brown or orange, fine-grained, and less resinous
than that of the other important Southern pines. It
is used for finishing, general construction, veneers,
paper pulp, excelsior, cooperage, mine props, and other
purposes.</p>

E. O. Siecke State Forest near Kirbyville in 1926. It
has been widely planted in East Texas, and has been
so successful in its growth and adaptability to the

It forms a tall, wide-spreading, rather open head. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bark">BARK</a>
is dark, rough, divided into ridges, and usually from 1 to 1&frac12;
inches thick. It seldom comprises the principal species of any
forest stands, but more often occurs as individual trees. It attains
a diameter of more than 3 feet and a height of more than
100 feet, but is usually smaller.</p>

<br /><span class="small"><b>Aralia spinosa</b> L.</span></h3>
<p>This tree, a native of Northeast Texas, is armed
from the ground up with many sharp spines, a
characteristic that has given the tree many names
such as Hercules-club, prickly-elder, and prickly-ash.
The last name properly belongs to another tree. Devils-walkingstick
possesses sufficient beauty to compensate
for its spitefulness. The tree is usually small,
but occasionally attains a height of 30 feet, the leaves
forming a flat-topped, spreading <a class="gloss" href="#g_Crown">crown</a>.</p>

<p>The brown <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bark">BARK</a> is divided by broad shallow
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Fissures">fissures</a> into circular, horizontal ridges. The sharp
spines along its trunk best identify this tree.</p>
<p>The LEAVES are doubly compounded, or bi-pinnate,
the main <a class="gloss" href="#g_Rachis">rachis</a> (leaf-stem) 3 or 4 feet long,
clasping the stem with an enlarged base, and leaving
conspicuous scars when they fall. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Oval">oval</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Leaflets">leaflets</a>
are toothed, pointed, dark green above and paler beneath.
They turn yellow in autumn.</p>
<p>In mid-summer each plant bears one immense
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Panicle">panicle</a> of small, white FLOWERS, which rises well
above the leaves. The tree presents its most striking
appearance in autumn when the small black <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fruit">FRUIT</a>

<p>The greenish FLOWERS on long, slender peduncles appear
in early spring when the leaves are about one-third grown.
They are usually of two kinds, the male in many-flowered heads,
and the female in two or several-flowered clusters on different
trees. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Fruit">FRUIT</a> is drupe-like, dark blue &#8532; inch long, containing
a single hard-shelled stone, and is borne 2 to 3 in a
cluster on 1 to 2&frac12;-inch peduncles.</p>
<p>The WOOD is very tough, cross-grained, not durable in
contact with the soil, hard to work, and warps easily. Once considered
a weed tree, the species is now valuable for basket
veneer, box boards, and paper pulp. In the old days, the hollow
trunks were used for &ldquo;bee-gums.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
